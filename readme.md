# Reactive Javascript

> This work started as [this gist](https://gist.github.com/loreanvictor/ef4fbc84e6be32adfb1404d6e0e7d05e) and I am now in the process of better organizing it within this repository.

Reactive programming in JavaScript is not easy, as it is not directly supported by the language itself. The community has tried to address this shortcoming via frameworks that try to solve it specifically for client side applications (like [React](https://reactjs.org)), and reactive programming utilities and libraries (the most famous being [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev)) that address this issue in isolation.

Nevertheless, the status quo still feels lacking for such a fundamental use case of JavaScript. Frameworks mostly need to bend the semantics of the language (e.g. [React components are NOT like other functions](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#rules-of-hooks)) and libraries shift towards paradigms that increase code complexity (e.g. the FRP style of RxJS). Per 2021 State of JS Survey, amongst features missing from JavaScript, [native support for observables was ranked as fifth](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/opinions/#currently_missing_from_js_wins).

<details open><summary>React Example</summary>

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function Counter({ name }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0) 
  // ‚òùÔ∏è this function can only be used in a React component.

  const color = count % 2 === 0 ? 'red' : 'blue'
  // ‚òùÔ∏è `color` is recalculated even when `count` has not changed.
  
  // üëá a new function is defined every time `count` has a new value.
  //    a new function is also redefined whenever `name` changes.
  function incr() {
    setCount(count + 1)
  }
  
  return <div onClick={incr} style={{ color }}>
    { name || 'You' } have clicked {incr} times!
  </div>
}
```

<details><summary>RxJS Example</summary>

```js
import { map, fromEvent, scan } from 'rxjs'

// üëá FRP style programming is not convenient for many developers.
//    JavaScript is NOT a functional language, so combination of these styles
//    inevitably increases code complexity.
const count = fromEvent(button$, 'click').pipe(scan(c => c + 1, 0))
const color = count.pipe(map(c => c % 2 === 0 ? 'red' : 'blue'))

count.subscribe(c => span$.textContent = c)
color.subscribe(c => div$.style.color = c)
```

This work is an invesitagtion of a potential syntactic solution to this shortcoming. The main idea is to be able to treat observable values as plain values in expressions, thus removing syntactic overhead required for conducting basic operations on observable values (re-evaluation of functional components in React, FRP-style programming with RxJS).

<details open><summary>React Example Re-written</summary>

```jsx
function Counter({ name }) {
  let @count = 0
  // ‚òùÔ∏è this can be used anywhere, with the same meaning.
  
  const @color = (@count % 2 === 0) ? 'red' : 'blue'
  // ‚òùÔ∏è `color` is recalculated only when `count` has changed.

  // üëá the click callback is defined once
  return(
    <div onclick={() => @count++} style={{ color }}>
      { name || 'You' } have clicked { count } times!
    </div>
  )
}
```

<details><summary>Same Example without JSX</summary>

```js
// No need for FRP style programming

let @count = 0
button$.addEventListener('click', () => @count++)

observe {
  span$.textContent = @count;
  if (@count % 2 === 0) {
    div$.style.color = 'red'
  } else {
    div$.style.color = 'blue'
  }
}
```

<details><summary>Same Example with DOM API Support</summary>

```js
let @count = 0
const @color = (@count % 2 === 0) ? 'red' : 'blue'

button$.addEventListener('click', () => @count++)
span$.textContent = count
div$.style.color = color
```

# Terminology

üëâ For more precise definitions of various terms and expressions used in this repository regarding reactive programming and observables (such as _observable_, _shared observation_, _flattening_, etc.), [read the _definitions_ document](definitions.md).

<br>

# Core Idea
The main idea is to add a syntax to _flatten_ observables so that their values is usable in expressions just as plain values are. This is similar to what `await` syntax does for `Promise`s: without it, you need to pass handler functions to be able to access values wrapped within a `Promise`:

```js
const a = new Promise(...)
const b = a.then(_a => _a + 2)
```

With the `await` keyword, `Promise`s get flattened, so their value can be used in normal expressions:

```js
const a = new Promise(...)
const b = (await a) + 2
```

<br>

Similarly, we could have a syntactic solution for flattening observables:

```js
const a = makeObservable(...)
const b = a.pipe(map(_a => _a + 2))
```
```js
const a = makeObservable(...)
const b = @a + 2
```

<br>

Similar to how flattening `Promise`s can only occur in asynchronous contexts, flattening observables can also only occur in observable contexts ([read this for more on why](context.md)). This can be achieved with a construct similar to anonymous async functions, explicitly specifying boundaries of an observable context:

```js
const a = makeObservable(...)
const b = @ => @a + 2
```

Which _can_ be further simplified by introducing an _observable creation_ construct:

```js
const a = makeObservable(...)
const @b = @a + 2

// ‚òùÔ∏è this is shorthand for
// const b = @ => @a + 2
```

Similar to an anonymous function, the observable _"function"_ can also have a complete function body:

```js
const b = @ => { return @a + 2 }
```

Which allows executing side effects as well:

```js
const b = @ => {
  console.log('new value: ' + @a)
  return @a + 2
}
```

üëâ [Read this](flattening.md) for more details on the proposed syntax for observable flattening.

<br>

Unlike `Promise`s, which are immediately executed, observables are _lazy_, which means they don't get executed until they are observed. To facilitate this, an additional syntactic construct can be created in form of a new keyword, `observe`:

```js
observe { console.log(@a) }
```

Which would be equivalent to:

```js
a.subscribe(_a => console.log(_a))
```

Or:

```js
(@ => { console.log(@a) }).subscribe()
```

This syntax can be further enhanced to allow handling errors that occur on execution path of an observation and finalize the whole process:

```js
observe {
  console.log(@a + 2)
} catch (error) {
  // an error has occured while computing new values for this observation,
  // which terminates the observation.
  console.log('Something went wrong ...')
} finally {
  // the observation is finished because all of its observable sources have
  // finished producing data.
  console.log('a is completed now.')
}
```
Which would be equivalent to:
```js
a.subscribe(
  _a => console.log(_a + 2),
  (error) => {
    console.log('Something went wrong ...')
  },
  () => {
    console.log('a is completed now.')
  }
)
```
